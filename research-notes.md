INTRODUCTION
In 2025, Albania became the first country to appoint an AI system, Diella, as a “virtual minister” in charge of public procurement. The government claims it will reduce corruption and make decisions more fair. Many citizens and experts, however, worry about legality, transparency, and accountability.
This research summarizes the reasons the government chose AI (pros) and the reasons people dislike or distrust it (con)

PROS - Why the Government Supports Diella
1. To Fight Corruption
Public procurement in Albania has a long history of bribery and political influence.
The government believes an AI cannot be:
•	bribed
•	intimidated
•	pressured politically
This makes decisions appear more neutral.

2. Faster & More Efficient
AI can:
•	analyze documents quickly
•	process tenders faster
•	reduce long bureaucratic delays

3. Transparency Signals
Officials claim Diella leaves digital logs and makes rule-based decisions. It also allows Albania to present itself as modern and reform-oriented, especially for EU membership.

4. Consistent Decision-Making
Humans have bias, get tired, or make errors.
AI applies rules the same way every time.

5. International Reputation
Being “first in the world” helps Albania appear innovative and tech-forward.

 CONS - Why Many Citizens Dislike or Distrust Diella
1. No Democratic Legitimacy
Under normal law, a minister should be a human citizen who can:
•	vote
•	be questioned
•	be held responsible
AI cannot be held accountable.

2. Black-Box Decision Making
The public does not know:
•	the algorithm
•	the data it uses
•	how it chooses winners
This destroys transparency instead of improving it.

3. Risk of Hidden Bias
If the AI is trained on old corrupted data, it may repeat the same unfair patterns, but automatically.

4. No Human Judgment
Procurement requires:
•	context
•	ethics
•	exceptions
AI follows rules but cannot understand human needs, fairness, or local realities.

5. Accountability Problems
If Diella makes a bad or biased decision:
•	Who is responsible?
•	The programmer?
•	The government?
•	No one?
This makes governance risky.

6. Data & Security Concerns
If the AI uses foreign cloud providers, sensitive government data could be exposed or misused.

IN CONCLUSION
Diella represents a bold experiment in AI governance.
Government likes it because it promises fairness, speed, anti-corruption, and modernity.
Citizens and experts dislike it because it raises issues of legality, transparency, bias, and accountability.
And whether it becomes a success or a risky political showpiece depends entirely on how Albania regulates and oversees the system.
